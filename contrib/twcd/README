Twin CD
-------
This is my attempt at a program for TWIN, a text-mode windowing environment
available at http://linuz.sns.it/~max/twin/. It's in infancy (my program
and the environment), but it's quite usable (both of them, again).

TWCD has a long way to go before it's as good as something like kscd or tcd,
but it plays CDs, and it's the only TWIN CD player. As far as I know, it's
also the first (and only) 3rd party application for TWIN.

Compiling
---------
The latest version can be downloaded from
http://sacredchao.net/piman/software.html

TWCD requires libTw, from TWIN, and the cdaudio library (available with
most distributions, or from freshmeat.net.)
