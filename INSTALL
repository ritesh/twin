Building and installing twin

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To compile twin you need the following programs installed
on your system:
	
  * recent GNU make (versions <= 3.76.1 do not to work)

  * ANSI C compiler (gcc for example)


But of course you may want to know more details:
First, you might want to edit the files `makerules.in' and `makeautoconf.in'
to change the install directory, tweak compiler flags (enable debugging), etc.

First you may want to tweak the configuration options, install directory,
compiler flags, etc. generated by `./configure'; this is possible with
`./configure [options]' or `scripts/Configure.sh [configuration options]'

For instructions about compiling and installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
sections 3 and 4, distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.


For a discussion about MANUALLY configuring twin (almost never necessary),
see the help file `Configure', again in the docs/ subdirectory.
-- WARNING: if you manually enable options that were disabled by `./configure',
build will almost certainly fail! --
