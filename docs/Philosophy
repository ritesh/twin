		Philosophy and goals of the 'twin' project:

Twin is intended to be a text mode window environment. It brings mouse
support, multiple indipendent windows, window manager, terminal emulator, and
server for remote applications, all in a text mode display.

All base features are already implemented, but there is much room for
expansion. Planned features are:

* A whole desktop environment, all running in text mode. This includes:
* A toolkit library with user configurable look-n-feel and rich widget
  set (already in progress).
* Programs for all tasks a user could perform while using a text display.
  Image viewers are probably ruled out (but see aalib), yet most other
  programs are possible: editor, taskbar, file manager, web browser, mail
  client, frontend to existing tty-based programs (gdb comes to mind).
  In most cases, existing programs can be used just adding small changes
  to better exploit 'twin' features, or even without modifications:

  editor: emacs & clones, vi & clones
  file manager: midnight commander
  web browser: links
  mail clients: pine, mutt, ...

  so the work is infinitely smaller than say, writing KDE or GNOME from
  scratch.
